    <p id="secondp">My favorite hobby is playing basketball at my backyard. When I have enough time, I would play basketball. I can shoot hoops at the freethrow range of two points, I can do some trickshots, and I can dribble the ball. I had seen lots of people do trickshots. Also, I can get fresh air when I play basketball. I really like to do the dribbling and I had played basketball on my basketball class since I was in third grade. I actually played some mini-games of basket ball that my basketball teacher know such as "Horse". The goal is that you have to be the last standing person to win. If you miss five times and get the letters that spell HORSE, you lose. Even I liked the warm-ups. The warm-ups made me feel great.</p>
